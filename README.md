R: Yes

**Write a little description of what this code is doing** <br />
R: This code abstract the logic of two fake integration libraries of different marketplaces in Adapters.

**Why submit this code?** <br />
R: I made this code more than 1 year ago but I'm proud of it. Because I love to learn design patterns and see how they solve problems for us. In my previous experiences as a developer, we used many external libraries that became deprecated or needed to make a change in source but we don't have access or knowledge to make these changes. So using Adapter pattern we solve these problems and have a layer that separates the code that we had control from what we don't.
